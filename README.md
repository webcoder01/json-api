# About

Json-Api helps you generate API responses that comply with the JSON:API specification.
This package is framework agnostic, you can use it in a vanilla PHP project.

For more information about this specification, go to [https://jsonapi.org/](https://jsonapi.org/).

For now, you can generate both success and error responses. More features may be introduced in the future.

# Installation
